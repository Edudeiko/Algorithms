#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Here is the case of **O(n)** (n * n) n times. **While** loop gets bigger as **n** number grows. It will run for a longer period of time as **n** incrcreases.


b) It is a **O(n^2)** complexity. Nested loops depends on the size of **n**. When **n** increases, number of iterations increases as well. Inner iterations will increase outer loop.


c) **O(n)** add bunnies to the Stack.

## Exercise II


**f >= breaks**

**f < not breaks**

**f == number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized**

I would implement a Binary search:

`(1)` 2 3 4 `(5)` 6 7 8 `(9)`

First start with middle `5` if eggs break take a middle from `1` to `5`, if it doesn't break take a middle between `5` and `9`. Continue moving until 'not breaks' floor is found. Binary search has **O(log(n))** complexity.
